This is a set of code created for Research Project 3 - "Sustainable Energy in Challenging Environments". The first file details the power curve (Vestas V90) and the Weibull distrubition of wind speeds based on Canada GOV Data.
The second file compares what the percentage breakdown for amounts of power we can expect given the spread of winds over an average year.
